# Metadata & Frontmatter Usage

## Summary
Describes how metadata controls ObsidiaNavi’s relationship system.

## Details

This section explains how Navi uses **YAML frontmatter** — the structured metadata block at the top of each note — to determine how notes are linked together.

The notes in this section will show you:

- What metadata is required for Navi to function
- How the number and order of fields shape the hierarchy
- How Navi recognizes parents, siblings, and children
- How to add date metadata for dynamic daily navigation

If you’ve already run Navi once, you’ve seen these links in action — now you’ll understand exactly how they’re generated, and how to shape them to fit your vault’s content.
