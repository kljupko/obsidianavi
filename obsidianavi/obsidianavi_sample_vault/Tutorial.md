# Tutorial

## Summary
This note serves as the starting point for anyone who wants to learn how to use Navi in practice.

## Details

Welcome to the **Navi Tutorial**.

In just **three short steps**, you’ll learn how to use Navi to link the notes in this vault — and by doing that, you’ll understand how to link your own.

You won’t need to configure anything or read dozens of pages. Just follow the steps — one note at a time — and you’ll be running your first Navi command before you know it.

> Start with step 1/3: **[[Getting Started]]** — it’s the first step on this short path.

Once you've completed the 3-step guide, you’ll also have the option to go deeper into:

- How to customize Navi's configuration
- What each CLI option does
- How to control how links are styled
- How frontmatter drives the relationships
- And how to test Navi on your own or sample vaults

All of that is included in the Tutorial section — but none of it is required to begin.

Take one step at a time. Let’s start with the basics.
