# Getting Started

## Summary
Introduces the structure of the vault and prepares you to run ObsidiaNavi for the first time.

## Details

You’re just a few steps away from seeing Navi in action.

Before we run the tool, it’s helpful to understand how your **Obsidian vault** should be organized — because Navi works by reading the metadata inside your notes.

Here’s what you need to know:

- All the notes in this vault (both **Information** and **Tutorial**) contain frontmatter — the YAML block at the top of each file.
- That frontmatter defines each note’s **place in a hierarchy**, which Navi uses to link related notes together.
- The tool doesn't require special folders or filenames — it works purely from metadata.

If you're curious about how the frontmatter works, you can explore that later in the tutorial under "Metadata & Frontmatter Usage." But for now, just know: **this vault is already correctly set up.**

You’re ready to move on to the next step: understanding Vault structure.

> Head to **[[Vault Structure]]** (step 2/3) for a quick explanation of how everything fits together.
