# Concepts: Foundations

## Summary
Outlines the key ideas that define ObsidiaNavi’s metadata-driven approach to linking Obsidian notes.

## Details
This group of notes establishes the conceptual groundwork for how Navi functions:

- **Relationships**: Defines parent, sibling, and child links based on metadata.
- **Frontmatter Model**: Explains how YAML frontmatter is used to infer structure.

Together, these concepts clarify the mental model needed to understand how Navi organizes content in a note vault.
